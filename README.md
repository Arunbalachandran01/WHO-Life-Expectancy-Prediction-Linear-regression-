## Business Understanding
### Problem Identification
Although several studies on the factors influencing life expectancy taking into account demographic demographics, income composition, and mortality rates have been conducted in the past. It was discovered that the impact of vaccinations and the human development index had not previously been taken into consideration. Additionally, a number of earlier studies used data from all the countries collected over the course of one year and multiple linear regression. This provides incentive to develop a regression model based on a mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while taking data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries in order to address both of the previously mentioned problems. Hepatitis B, polio, and diphtheria vaccinations are also important to consider. In a summary, this study will concentrate on aspects associated to immunisation, mortality, the economy, society, and other health-related factors. A country will find it easier to identify the predicting factor causing a lower value of life expectancy as the observations in this dataset are based on multiple countries. This will assist in recommending to a nation which region should be prioritised in order to effectively raise the population's life expectancy.
Variables
### Explanation on life dataset:
•	Country - Country Observed.
•	Year - Year Observed.
•	Status - Developed or Developing status.
•	Life.expectancy - Life Expectancy in age.
•	Adult.Mortality - Adult Mortality Rates on both sexes (probability of dying between 15-60 years/1000 population).
•	Infant.deaths - Number of Infant Deaths per 1000 population.
•	Alcohol - Alcohol recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol).
•	percentage.expenditure - Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%).
•	Hepatitis.B - Hepatitis B (HepB) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
•	Measles - Number of reported Measles cases per 1000 population.
•	BMI - Average Body Mass Index of entire population.
•	under.five.deaths - Number of under-five deaths per 1000 population.
•	Polio - Polio (Pol3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
•	Total expenditure - General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%).
•	Diphtheria - Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
•	HIV_AIDS - Deaths per 1 000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years).

### Objectives
Based on the life dataset, the objective is to predict the Life.expectancy of the people, using given dependent variables.
### Data Collection
The initiative depends on the data being accurate. The World Health Organization (WHOGlobal)'s Health Observatory (GHO) data repository monitors each nation's health status as well as a number of other relevant variables. For the goal of analysing health data, the data sets are made available to the general public. The WHO data repository website was used to acquire the data set pertaining to life expectancy, health factors for 193 nations, and its equivalent economic data was obtained from the United Nations website. Only the most representative critical factors from each category of health-related factors were selected. 
The data was collected from WHO and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang.
